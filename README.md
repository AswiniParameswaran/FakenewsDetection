# FakenewsDetection
📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based solution to classify news articles as Real or Fake. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning algorithms to identify fake news content based on textual features.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Detect and classify news as fake or real using machine learning models.

Language: Python

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK

Techniques: Text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes / etc.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains news articles with their respective labels:

1: Real news

0: Fake news

Common columns include:

title: Headline of the news

text: Body of the news

label: Target column (1 for real, 0 for fake)
